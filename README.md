## Overview

This repository contains the complete set of original and enhanced artifacts used for my **CS-499 Capstone Project**.  
The primary artifact is **Travlr Getaways**, a full-stack travel booking application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

As required by the capstone, this project includes **three major enhancements**:

1. **Software Engineering & Design**
2. **Algorithms & Data Structures**
3. **Databases & Analytics**

Each enhancement demonstrates proficiency in core computer science competencies and aligns with CS-499 program outcomes.

All enhancements are documented and integrated into a professional GitHub Pages portfolio.
